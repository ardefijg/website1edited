            <p><b>Moving pieces:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pieces move one square at a time forward, backward or sideways (never diagonally).</li>

                <li>As an exception, the <b>scout</b> may move any number of unoccupied squares forward, backward or
                    sideways. Moving more than one square will reveal its rank.</li>

                <li>Pieces cannot jump over another piece.</li>

                <li>Pieces cannot move onto a square already occupied by another piece, unless attacking.</li>

                <li>Pieces cannot move onto or through the lakes in the middle of the board.</li>

                <li><b>Flag</b> and <b>bombs</b> cannot move; they remain in the square they were positioned at initial
                    setup.</li>

                <li>There are additional rules that prevent a piece from performing an otherwise legal move. <a
                        href="howother.html" class="howlink"> Other Rules</a></li>



            </ul>
            <br>
            <p><b>Attacking pieces</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>You may attack any opponent piece that is adjacent to one of your moveable pieces.</li>
                <li>
                    The <b>scout</b> may attack an opponent piece right after it moved (in the same turn). This means it
                    may
                    attack any piece that is in the same row or column, given that there is no other piece (or lake)
                    between them.You may attack any opponent piece that is adjacent to one of your moveable pieces.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Attacking and attacked piece ranks are revealed, and one or both pieces are captured (removed from
                    the board).
                </li>

                <li>If the attacking piece has the higher rank, the lower (attacked) piece is captured and the attacking
                    piece occupies its square.</li>

                <li>If the attacking piece has the lower rank it is captured (the higher attacked piece stays in its
                    square).</li>

                <li>If both pieces are equal ranks, they are both removed from the board.</li>

                <li>The <b>flag</b> is captured by any attacking piece.</li>

                <li>Any piece will be captured if it attacks a <b>bomb</b>, except for the <b>miner</b>, who has the
                    ability to
                    defuse them (meaning the bomb is captured when attacked by a miner).</li>

                <li>As a special privilege, the <b>spy</b> captures the opponent <b>marshal</b> when attacking it (but the marshal
                    will capture the spy if it attacks first).</li>

            </ul>

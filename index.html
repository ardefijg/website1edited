            <p> Stratego is a strategy board game for two players on a 10 by 10 square board. Each
                player controls 40 pieces representing individual officer and soldier ranks in an army.
                The objective of the game is to either find and capture the opponent's Flag or to capture
                so many enemy pieces that the opponent cannot make any further moves.</p>
            <p>The average game has 381 moves. The number of legal positions is 10115. The number of possible games is
                10535. Stratego has many more moves and possible board states than other familiar games such as chess;
                however, unlike those games where a single bad move at any point may result in loss of the game, most moves
                in Stratego are inconsequential as players think in 'games not moves'.</p>
            <p>'Stratego' originates from the French or Greek strategos (var. strategus) for leader of an ancient (especially Greek)
                army first general.</p>

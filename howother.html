            <p><b>Winning the Game</b>:</p>
            
            <p>The first player to capture the opponent flag wins the game. </p>

            <p>If a player cannot move or attack in his/her turn, he/she loses the game. This is possible if all
                moveable pieces have been captured or they are blocked (by bombs and/or flag). </p>
            <p>In the exceptional case that after an attack both pieces are captured and neither player can move any
                further, the game ends in a draw. </p>

            <br>

            <p><b>Additional moving rule: three moves on two squares</b></p>

            <p>A piece cannot move back and forth between the same two squares more than three consecutive times
                (turns). This is regardless of the piece being just moved or also attacking an opponent piece in those
                squares. </p>
            <p>After moving the same piece over the same two squares in three consecutive turns, in his/her next turn
                the player should move any other piece. If this is not possible, they must surrender and opponent wins
                the game. </p>
            <p>To include the scouts in this rule it is generalized as: a piece cannot cross the same square boundary
                more than three consecutive times. This means that a scout can move back and forth over the same row (or
                column) as long as it does not cross a square boundary more than three times. </p>

            <br>
            <p><b>Additional moving rule: more squares or continuous chasing</b></p>

            <p>It is not allowed to continuously "chase" one or more opponent pieces. Chasing is defined as moving a
                piece adjacent to an opponent piece ("threatening"), and he/she moving it away in the immediate
                following turn ("evading"). </p>
            <p>If a chasing move would lead to a position on the board which has already taken place ("board
                repetition") this potential move is considered illegal and the player should perform another move. </p>
            <p>As an exception, moving a piece back to the square where it was in the immediate preceding turn is always
                allowed, as long as the two-squares rule is not violated. This is regardless of the piece being in a
                chasing situation. </p>

                
            <p>For reference, some typical chasing situations are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A piece running after another around a lake or around an isolated bomb.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A piece continuously threatening another (diagonally positioned) by moving within a 2 by 2 area.
                </li>
            </ul>
